# Word-Guess-Python
My 3rd Word Guess application, written in Python and uses the Python CLI

Theme: Popular fruits
Players have 9 changes to guess the letters in a random word from a list of fruits, Hangman style. 

Early Development: Finer game mechanics to be fixed and balance

Future plans: larger word pools, players able to choose a category, backend functionality (saved scores, adjusted diificulty
for player accounts, etc.)
